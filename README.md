# Optimization Strategies for Local Package Delivery Operations

---

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing **local package delivery operations** through computational algorithms and heuristic search strategies.  
It models the delivery process as a **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** variant, aiming to minimize total distance, delivery time, or cost while satisfying operational constraints such as capacity, service time, and route limits.

The project implements and compares optimization algorithms including **Simulated Annealing**, **Genetic Algorithms**, and heuristic methods to identify efficient delivery routes.

## Objectives

- Formulate the local package delivery problem as an optimization task  
- Implement and test different optimization techniques (heuristic and metaheuristic)  
- Compare solution quality, computation time, and algorithm efficiency  
- Provide a modular and extendable simulation framework for future enhancements

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/msalem02/Optimization-Strategies-for-Local-Package-Delivery-Operations.git
cd Optimization-Strategies-for-Local-Package-Delivery-Operations

### 2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Run the Project
python main.py

You can configure parameters (number of vehicles, population size, cooling rate, etc.) inside the script or configuration file.

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Simulated Annealing (SA)
- Starts with an initial solution and iteratively improves it by random swaps  
- Accepts worse solutions with a probability that decreases over time (temperature cooling)  
- Useful for escaping local minima  

### 2. Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- Evolves a population of solutions through crossover and mutation  
- Selects the fittest individuals to form the next generation  
- Balances exploration and exploitation for global optimization  

### 3. Heuristic Methods
- Greedy nearest-neighbor initialization  
- Two-opt local search for route refinement  
- Hybrid variants that combine heuristic and metaheuristic components

## Results Summary

| Algorithm          | Total Distance | Time (s) | Notes |
|--------------------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| Simulated Annealing | 312.8 km       | 18.5      | Stable performance, fast convergence |
| Genetic Algorithm   | 305.2 km       | 32.1      | Best overall performance |
| Heuristic           | 328.7 km       | 4.3       | Very fast but suboptimal |

Plots and route visualizations can be found in the `results/` directory.

## Key Insights

- Metaheuristic approaches (SA, GA) outperform simple heuristics in terms of solution quality  
- SA provides good balance between speed and accuracy, suitable for near real-time routing  
- GA yields globally optimal routes but requires longer computation  
- Hybrid approaches can combine benefits of both methods  

---

## Future Work

- Integrate real-world delivery constraints (traffic, time windows, driver shifts)  
- Extend to multi-depot or dynamic routing problems  
- Add visualization dashboard for route mapping  
- Parallelize algorithms for large-scale optimization
